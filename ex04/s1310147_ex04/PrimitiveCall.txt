(x, y) = (8, 5)
(x, y) = (8, 5)


In Java, when passing arguments to methods, in the case of primitive data types, their values are passed by copying. 
This means that a new variable is created, the value is copied to it, and this copy is used within the method. 
Therefore, even if the value of the argument is changed within the method, it does not affect the original variable.
In detail, in the test() method, the values of x and y are initialized to 8 and 5 respectively, and when the movePoint() method is called, these values are copied. 
Then, within the movePoint() method, even though x is changed to 100 and y to 120, this only affects the copied values. No changes are made to the original variables x and y.
